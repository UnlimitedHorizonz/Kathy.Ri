<h3>Survey results:

</li> parents are paying good money for you to attend this institution, 
    and this is how you show your gratitude?</li>
 </li> I want All of you to know that this food you rated so low, is what your parents request for your diet.  
    They wanted you to have an organic diet, and that is why you do not have 
    the unhealthy variety you see at your friends institutions.</li>
</li>This organic diet is very benificial to your learning and keeping your bodies in balance.  In our last 
    survey, we asked for your input on meal ideas, and many of you did not 
    respond. 
</li> you want your meals to be catered to your personal liking, I suggest you 
    take the time to complete the survey.</li>
